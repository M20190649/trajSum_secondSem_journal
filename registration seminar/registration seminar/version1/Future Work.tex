\section{Future Work}

Two objectives have been worked on, and three other remain. As mentioned earlier, the next steps of work are listed as follows :

\begin{itemize}
\item Trajectory Clustering : We intend to run hierarchical clustering on the similarity matrix obtained from the similarity measure defined, and come up with a heuristic to automatically choose the right number of clusters. 
\item Trajectory Summarization : An algorithm has to be devised to find the representative trajectory for a cluster. An efficient way of storing the clusters is also an area to be explored.
\item Applications: Once the mobility summary of an individual is obtained, work has to be done to predict the next location and find anomalies. 
\end{itemize}

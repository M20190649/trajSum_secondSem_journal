\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

From a raw input of GPS traces, the final clusters of the \emph{movement summary} have been reported. This included preprocessing, defining a similarity measure, clustering the trajectories, and coming up with a heuristic to determine the optimal number of clusters. 
In future, the following activities will be taken up - comparisons for trajectory clustering, devising a better heuristic to find the optimal number of clusters, trajectory summarization, an efficient way of storing the clusters, and applications of \emph{mobility summary}.
